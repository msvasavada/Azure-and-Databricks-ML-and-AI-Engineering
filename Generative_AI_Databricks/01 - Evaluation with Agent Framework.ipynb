         "[context_sufficiency] The root cause of failure is traced to the negative rating of context_sufficiency. See the context_sufficiency rationale for more details. **Suggested Actions**: First, you should ensure that the vector DB contains the missing information. Second, you should tune your retrieval step to retrieve the missing information (see the judges' rationales to understand what's missing). Here are some methods that you can try for this: retrieving more chunks, trying different embedding models, or over-fetching & reranking results.",

However, the retrieved context provided is about the Unity Catalog CLI for Databricks, which includes information on managing data recipients, creating and rotating tokens, and altering recipient settings.
